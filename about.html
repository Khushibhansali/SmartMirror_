    <h2>MediaPipe Facemesh</h2>
    <h3>MediaPipe Facemesh is a lightweight machine learning pipeline predicting 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of a human face <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06724.pdf">(paper)</a>. </h3>

    <h2>Smart Mirror </h2>
    <h3>Following basic human rights principal that all individuals have equal access to society, we created a Smart Mirror that uses AI to help people with dementia apply makeup to feel confident and be in charge of the person they want to be.

    In this project, we considered user centered design to build a makeup assistant for people with dementia, or people who have trouble wearing makeup in general. This section of the project extracts certain regions of a face such as eyes and lips in order to focus on color changes and accuracy of makeup application in that region of the face.</h3>
